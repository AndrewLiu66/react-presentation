# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Basic Intruction

This repository contains code examples in the react presentation. For the react part, the entry point of the repository is the App.js file. You can uncomment code in App.js to run different components, all the components are located under the component directory under the src directory.

During the presentation, I presented two examples(the count example and the todolist example) written in the traditional way (only use html, css and javascript), these two examples are demonstrated by using the two html files(Traditional_click_count.html and Traditional_todo_list.html). To see these two examples, just simple run the two html files in the browsers.

## Available Scripts

Before you start,you should have npm installed, and run the following script in terminal to download all the dependencies

### `npm i`

and then to run the react project, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
